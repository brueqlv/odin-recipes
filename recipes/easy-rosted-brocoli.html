        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled. My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>14 ounces brocoli</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C</li>
            <li>Cut broccoli florets from stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices.
                Mix flores and stem pieces with olive oil in the bowl and tranfer to a baking
                sheet; season with salt an pepper.
            </li>
